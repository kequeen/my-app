# React学习

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
react demo，就是测试下react的各种功能，以及各种表单或者UI组件，想学习一个新东西的最好方法，就是动手去实践，”把手弄脏“

最近重新理解了学习之道，最快的学习方式，是我们去用这个技术，去做我们想做的事情，或者是说我们想做的事情，刚好能够用到这个技术

## 关于自己对React的理解
目前个人理解，不一定准确。前端的技术其实核心分为2类，一类是css等样式相关，这种不是react所关心的；一种是js。
页面如何渲染，正常是浏览器加载完成html内容后，css和js执行，其实整个行为很多时候不可预测，因为可能网络原因，js加载的前后顺序不一致，导致会出现问题，并且模块的复用，一直也没有一个规范。
react相对于js，有点像spring boot 对于java，提供了很多开箱即用的功能。
我很喜欢react的哲学，一切尽在js，连页面的渲染顺序，也都是由js所决定。

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
